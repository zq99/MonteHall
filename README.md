# Monte Hall Problem Simulation

The is a simulation built in Java to answer the following question proposed by the problem:

>Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

The solution allows you to configure the following parameters:

- Number of doors in game
- Number of games to run in the simulation
- Whether the contestant sticks with original choice
- Number of times to run simulation to get aggregate statistics
